Patch Code Overview

A Patch Code is a barcode-like symbol consisting of black bars and spaces.
It is commonly used by patch readers for image addressing and Color on the Fly operations.

Patch Codes include the following symbols:

Patch 1, 2, 3, 4

Toggle Patch

Transfer Patch

Patch 6

Each patch is available in both horizontal and vertical orientations.

Dimensions & Specifications

Patch Code symbols must adhere to strict dimensional requirements:

Wide bars: 0.20 in (5.0 mm) ± 0.01 in (0.25 mm)

Narrow bars & spaces: 0.08 in (2.03 mm) ± 0.01 in (0.25 mm)

Maximum overall width: 0.80 in (20 mm) ± 0.01 in (0.25 mm)

This implementation conforms to CAT No. 845 9380.

Font Usage

When using the Patch Code font:

At 36 pt size, one character measures approximately 0.83 in long.

To create a standard 2.5 in patch, combine three characters.

Example: "111"

Important Notes

Do NOT photocopy Patch Codes.
Photocopiers may distort dimensions (making black bars thicker and spaces narrower), which can cause scanning errors.
